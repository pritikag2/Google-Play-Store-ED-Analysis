Project Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Google Play Store data to uncover insights about app trends, ratings, and user feedback. The analysis involves data cleaning, type conversions, and statistical evaluations to better understand the dataset.

 Dataset
The dataset consists of various attributes such as app names, categories, ratings, reviews, installs, and price. The primary objective is to analyze and interpret both categorical and numerical variables.

Key Steps in Analysis
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent data.

Data Type Conversion: Transformed object data types into integers for numerical analysis.

Categorical Analysis: Explored app categories, distribution of ratings, and sentiment trends.

Numerical Analysis: Examined installs, reviews, and pricing impact on app success.

Visualizations: Used bar charts, histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots for better insights.

Tools & Technologies
Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

GitHub for version control and collaboration

Key Insights
Certain categories dominate the Play Store in terms of app count and installs.

Ratings and reviews play a significant role in app popularity.
